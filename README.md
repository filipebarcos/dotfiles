# A new era for my dotfiles


## Motivation

I had zsh taking a very long time to start and that was incredibly annoying. I
decided to put my dotfiles on a diet. I not only wanted to make it faster, but
also simpler.

## Old version

My old approach can still be found at `legacy` branch.

## How to use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/filipebarcos/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && \
cd ~/.dotfiles && \
script/setup
```
